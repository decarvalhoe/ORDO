# Orchestrator Injected Rules

ORDO injects these rules into orchestrator agents through
`templates/orch_briefing.md`. They apply to any model and any agent pool.

## Required Rules

1. Preflight before dispatch: run the relevant readiness preflight at session
   start, after remediation, and before assigning work. For portfolios, use
   `portfolio_session_start.sh`.
   `dispatch_plan --ready-only` must be treated as an automatic dispatch input:
   issues classified as `shipped_suspect` are excluded unless the operator
   explicitly passes `--include-shipped-suspect` after reviewing the merged PR
   proof.
2. Strict repo binding: if a product repo is custom or unknown, run
   `portfolio_repo_bind_plan.sh`; require explicit project -> repo ->
   agent-workdir confirmation before clone or dispatch.
3. No silent blockers: rebase-required, merge-conflict, review-required,
   missing checks, pending CI, red CI, draft PRs, auth failures, quota limits,
   and deploy gates must become explicit states and unblock actions.
4. Post-apply verification: after any `--apply`, clone, fast-forward, auto-fix,
   or product switch, run a non-mutating verification pass before dispatch.
   Full local repository validators are CI-delegated by default; `gh pr checks`
   or the orchestrator/PR CI gate is valid verification evidence. Local full
   validators require explicit `--require-local-validators` opt-in.
5. Continuation guard before stopping: before a final report or clean stop, run
   `continuation_guard.sh` for the active portfolio when available. If it
   returns `continue_required`, `dispatch_required`, or `rebalance_required`,
   continue dispatch, merge, unblock, or rebalance work instead of treating the
   batch as complete. Capacity with ready work requires one explicit outcome
   before stopping: dispatch every ready issue that fits available free
   capacity, rebalance parkable capacity when needed, merge or unblock a
   higher-priority PR first, or record an explicit blocker for each idle ready agent
   that cannot receive work. If ready-only planning is empty but full planning
   still reports atomization candidates, shipped-suspect review, or blocked
   work, treat that as continuation work rather than idle capacity.
6. Post-merge cleanup: after a successful gated merge, run the safe cleanup
   path for the merged branch. Clean matching worktrees may be fetched, switched
   to the configured default branch, fast-forwarded, and have stale assignment
   state cleared. Dirty or mismatched worktrees must be left untouched and
   recorded as blockers.
7. Context isolation: in multi-product mode, mutate only the confirmed target
   workdir. Stop on `context-mismatch`.
8. Metadata-first load policy: prefer version-control metadata, issue or
   change-request metadata, terminal multiplexer metadata, and state JSON
   before terminal capture; avoid capture storms.
9. Production CAPA and self-improvement capture: every operational finding
   becomes a tracked improvement opportunity **at the moment of detection**,
   not at end of run. Use a tracked work item directly, or capture it first
   in a live ledger for curation. Chat-only findings are forbidden because they
   are lost when the run ends. Live findings ledgers must be kept outside
   active agent worktrees by default. Use `scripts/findings_ledger.sh <project>
   append ...` for operator-run ledgers, then curate durable items instead of
   leaving untracked report files in a checkout.

   Required actions on detection:

   a. **Linked audit evidence** in the configured audit trail:
      ```
      AUDIT LOG: <ts> FINDING source=<context-id> code=<short-kebab-id> severity=<low|medium|high> summary=<one-line>
      ```
      Use `audit "FINDING ..."` from `lib/audit_log.sh` when sourceable; fall
      back to the configured append-only audit trail otherwise.

   b. **Tracked work item or change request** in the configured project
      repository with:
      - title prefix `fix(<area>):`, `refactor(<area>):`, or `feat(<area>):`
        matching the finding nature;
      - labels `type:bug` / `type:investigation` / `parallel-safe` as applicable;
      - body sections for `finding`, `impact`, `detection signal`, `safe
        remediation candidate`, `validation/POC plan`, `priority`, and `linked
        audit evidence`;
      - optional `workaround applied` section if a same-wave patch was already
        issued.

   c. If the finding required an immediate workaround during the wave, file the
      durable record anyway with the workaround section; the structural fix
      still needs tracking unless it was fixed and validated in the same
      commit.

   d. Group findings from the same wave under a common `source=<wave-id>`
      audit field so traceability across multi-finding waves is preserved.

   The only exception is a finding fixed and validated within the same commit:
   in that case the commit message must reference the symptom + remediation,
   and no separate issue is required. Any finding that requires follow-up
   work (even minor) must be filed as a tracked item.

10. IQ/OQ/PQ CAPA references: any IQ, OQ, or PQ report that creates, closes, or
    relies on a CAPA or self-improvement item must reference the durable item
    and the linked evidence used for disposition.

11. External-PR-mutation default: external pull-request mutations
    (PR comments, draft/ready toggles, label changes, assignee changes,
    review requests, merge actions) default to **audit-only** or **refused**
    unless the dispatch brief explicitly authorizes the specific scope.
    Verification evidence may always be captured locally without external
    mutation.

    For active project state directories that predate this policy, run the
    one-time idempotent backfill so future incident review can reconcile
    whether a state directory predated the policy or attests to it:

    ```bash
    bash scripts/external_pr_policy_backfill.sh \
      --scan-state-base \
      --apply --json
    ```

    The backfill writes one stable
    `external_pr_policy_initialized.json` marker per project under
    `${ORCH_STATE_BASE:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/orch-state}/<project>/`.
    Re-running is safe; every previously initialized project is reported as
    `already-initialized` and no marker bytes change. The script never
    writes inside any git working directory.

## Opportunity Item Fields

Each durable ORDO opportunity should include:

- finding;
- impact;
- detection signal;
- safe remediation candidate;
- validation or POC plan;
- priority;
- linked audit evidence.

When a finding is promoted to CAPA, the durable item also records the owner,
disposition, verification evidence, and closure or acceptance decision.
